{"name":"Fractional Chern Insulators","tagline":"","body":"### analytical counting rules\r\nWe provide [a reference implementation](https://github.com/fractionalized/counting) of the analytical counting rules for fractional Chern insulators with an arbitrary Chern numbers.\r\nWe consider only the simplest bosonic case, corresponding to the color-entangled generalizations of Halperin 221 states.\r\n\r\nFor a given system, the code enumerates all the zero modes of the pseudopotential Hamiltonian and builds the representation of the color-entangled magnetic translation operators over these zero modes. The output is the number of zero modes in each Bloch momentum sector.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please go to [the Github repository](https://github.com/fractionalized/counting).
