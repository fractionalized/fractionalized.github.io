{"name":"Fractional Chern Insulators","tagline":"","body":"### counting rules\r\nThis is a reference implementation of the analytical counting rules for fractional Chern insulators with an arbitrary Chern numbers. We consider only the simplest bosonic case, corresponding to the color-entangled generalizations of Halperin 221 states.\r\n\r\nFor a given system, the code enumerates all the zero modes of the pseudopotential Hamiltonian and builds the representation of the color-entangled magnetic translation operators over these zero modes. The output is the number of zero modes in each Bloch momentum sector.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
